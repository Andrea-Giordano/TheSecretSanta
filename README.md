# TheSecretSanta


## What's the Secret Santa? 
Secret Santa is a Western Christmas tradition in which members of a group or community are randomly assigned a person to whom they give a gift. 
The identity of the gift giver is to remain a secret and should not be revealed. 


## Why TheSecretSanta?
Facing an increasing pandemic boredness, I've decided to involve my closest friends in a REAL Secret Santa round for Christmas. Most Secret Santas is arranged
by a single person acting as a Deus Ex Machina knowing in advance all the participants and making a draw out of them. 

This mechanism only has one flaw...it's not a secret !!!

That's why I've decided to write this small application. I wanted secretness to be crucial for us. Here it is, TheSecretSanta takes as input the list of participants
to randomly assign them sending each one of them an email with the name of their lucky recipient.

Oh... and since it wasn't funny enough, I've added a list of constraints to be respected by the Santa for their gift!


## Can I use this application with my friends?
Yes! Go on! 


## How can I launch the application?
I'm assuming you know how to download it and how to use a terminal.
First of all, edit the resources/participants.txt and the resources/conditions.txt file with the name and emails of your friends and the constraints for your gifts.
Secondly, you need a valid email to send your friends notifications.

When you're, just run the application passing as param the email and password of the email. The application will take care of


## Is there a UI/Runnable to launch it?
I'm working on it :)


## Have fun!
